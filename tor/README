README for tor

PRECAUTION

    Make sure you edit /etc/pkgadd.conf and add the following line.

    UPGRADE         ^var/lib/tor/.*$    NO
    UPGRADE         ^etc/tor/torrc$     NO

    Failure to do so will result in the loss of your tor data and
    configuration upon update!

    If you edit the torrc file for extra logging, make sure you:
    chmod 0640 /var/log/tor/* files, for security reasons.

PRE-INSTALL

    Tor expects to have a user and group dedicated to it, a
    pre-install script has been added to the port which takes
    care of this.

NOTES

    If you want to use Tor DNS as default nameserver on port 53,
    dont forget to allow non-root process to bind a privileged port:

    sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /usr/bin/tor
