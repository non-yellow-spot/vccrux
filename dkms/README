README for dkms

NOTE

    Dynamic Kernel Module Support (DKMS) is a program/framework that
    enables generating Linux kernel modules whose sources generally
    reside outside the kernel source tree.

    To use this feature it is recommended to run dkms after compiling
    a new kernel, specifying the new kernel version with the flag -k.

    To list which modules you have that are in the dkms tree you can
    simply run
        dkms status

    Running the command
        dkms add -m <module> -v <version>
    will add the module to the dkms tree.

    Likewise running the command
        dkms build -m <module> -v <version>
    will build the module to the current kernel version,  or more
    specifically
        dkms build -m <module> -v <version> -k <kernelversion>
    will build the module for a chosen kernel version.

    If you'd like to build dkms modules on boot up then adding the
    lines below to  /etc/rc.modules  should suffice. However, this
    should be added before any modules that you wish to load with
    modprobe.

        if [ -x /usr/sbin/dkms ]; then 
            /usr/sbin/dkms autoinstall
        fi

    An example of what an /etc/rc.modules file would look like would be
    something like this.

        #!/bin/bash
        #
        # /etc/rc.modules: module initialization script
        #

        /sbin/depmod -a

        if [ -x /usr/sbin/dkms ]; then
            /usr/sbin/dkms autoinstall
        fi

        modprobe 88XXau
        modprobe tuxedo_keyboard

    You will find the location of the dkms links to your modules under
    the directory  /var/lib/dkms/<modules>-<version>.  There will be a
    source link directly to the location of the module which should be
    located under  /usr/src/<module>-<version>  unless the user
    specifies a different location.

    If you wish to remove a specific module you can run the command
        dkms remove -m <module> -v <version> -k <kernelversion>.

    For further information it is highly recommended that you read the
    man pages.
